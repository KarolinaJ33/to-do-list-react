# DEMO  [See To Do List](https://karolinaj33.github.io/to-do-list-react/)

# Description
I have created a simply to do list.
You can add tasks, mark as completed and remove from the list. 
You can also mark as complete all the tasks by choosing 'Ukończ wszystkie'.
After pressing 'Ukryj ukończone' selected tasks will disappear from the list. You can also download sample tasks by 'Pobierz przykładowe zadania" or search for any task in the search engine.
